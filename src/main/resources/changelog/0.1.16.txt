Breaking Changes:

* Made the fluid sprite and name mandatory components for the fluid key builder
* Renamed "FluidVolume.getTextComponent()" to "FluidVolume.getName()"

Changes:

* Fixed a crash when splitting a single unit of fluid from a BiomeSourcedFluidVolume
* Added methods to get the tooltip from a FluidKey itself as well as the FluidVolume
* Changed the sprite identifier for potions to "libblockattributes:fluid/potion" rather than the water one
* Fixed a bug where multiple biome sources for water didn't produce the corret render colour.
