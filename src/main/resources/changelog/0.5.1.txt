Additions:

* Added misc.Saveable interface, which includes "toTag" and "fromTag" methods.
    * FullFixedItemInv, DirectFixedItemInv, and SimpleFixedFluidInv implement this.
* Added saving methods to SimpleGroupedItemInv (how did I miss these ???)
    * Plus it now implements misc.Saveable
* Added LimitedFixedItemInv.ItemSlotLimitRule.disallowInsertion()
    * And the fluid variant.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed SimpleLimitedFixedItemInv exposing the delegate inventory, rather than itself.
  (so now the rules are correctly applied to insert/extract as well as setInvStack)
* Fixed CombinedItemInsertable.getInsertionFilter incorrectly combining insertion filters
  using AND rather than OR.
* Fixed CombinedItemInsertable pre-computing the insertion filter when there's no guarantee
  that the filters returned from the insertables will stay constant.
