Additions:

* Added misc.Saveable interface, which includes "toTag" and "fromTag" methods.
    * FullFixedItemInv, DirectFixedItemInv, and SimpleFixedFluidInv implement this.
* Added saving methods to SimpleGroupedItemInv (how did I miss these ???)
    * Plus it now implements misc.Saveable
* Added LimitedFixedItemInv.ItemSlotLimitRule.disallowInsertion()
    * And the fluid variant.
* Added many variants of FluidVolumeUtil.interactWithTank that take FluidInsertable
    and FluidExtractable or FluidTransferable instead of just FixedFluidInv. 

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed SimpleLimitedFixedItemInv exposing the delegate inventory, rather than itself.
  (so now the rules are correctly applied to insert/extract as well as setInvStack)
* Fixed CombinedItemInsertable.getInsertionFilter incorrectly combining insertion filters
  using AND rather than OR.
* Fixed CombinedItemInsertable pre-computing the insertion filter when there's no guarantee
  that the filters returned from the insertables will stay constant.
* Fixed FluidInsertable.getInsertionFilter() inserting Integer.MAX_VALUE of
  the fluid, which caused a few crashes when it was added to and overflowed.
* Fixed ImplicitFluidVolumeRenderer not using fabric api's FluidRenderHandlerRegistry
  to get the sprite. (Now it falls back to the block model rather than relying on it).
