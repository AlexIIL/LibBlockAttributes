Changes:

* Added FluidTypeFilter, for checking if a fluid is a raw (minecraft) fluid, a floating fluid, or of a particular registry.
* Added FluidWorldUtil.createFluidDrainer and FluidWorldUtil.createFluidPlacer, which return a FluidExtractable and FluidInsertable that operate on the world directly.
* Added a few additional variants of FluidVolumeUtil.move that take a Simulation parameter.
* Undeprecate IBucketItem and make FluidContainerRegistry use it.
