Breaking Changes:

* FluidExtractable is no longer a valid functional interface.
    * While it was never annotated with "@FunctionalInterface" it used to be 
      possible to use it as one.
* Changed the return type of "FluidInsertable.getMinimumAcceptedAmount" from an
  integer to a nullable FluidAmount.
* Renamed "FixedFluidInv.getView" to "getFixedView",
  and "GroupedFluidInv.getView" to "getGroupedView".
    * This is to allow a single class to implement both, without needing
      to redeclare the method with a custom return type.

Changes:

* Moved over from base-1620 fluids to fully fractional fluids.

Additions:

* Added RebornCore fluid compatibility.
