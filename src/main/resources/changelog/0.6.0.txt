Breaking Changes:

* FluidExtractable is no longer a valid functional interface.
    * While it was never annotated with "@FunctionalInterface" it used to be 
      possible to use it as one.
* Changed the return type of "FluidInsertable.getMinimumAcceptedAmount" from an
  integer to a nullable FluidAmount.
