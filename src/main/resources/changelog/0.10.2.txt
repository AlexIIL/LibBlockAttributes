Changes:

* Updated to 1.18.2
    * This version should still work on 1.18.1 however, if you don't want to update your mod but do want the other changes here.
* Added one-way compatibility with fabric's transfer API
    * Mods using LBA can insert into and extract from vanilla, LBA inventories, and transfer api inventries.
    * Mods using transfer API can only insert into and extract from vanilla and transfer api inventories.
        * If mods want to insert into and extract from LBA inventories they they will need to add compat with LBA.
* Removed legacy compatibility with TechReborn's fluid code, since it's moved over to transfer api.
* Fixed "FixedInventoryVanillaWrapper" not calling "Inventory.markDirty" whenever it changed the inventory.
