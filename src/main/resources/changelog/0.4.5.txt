Changes:

* Relicense from MIT to the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0
    * (Mostly to match BuildCraft's license, of which many parts of it were used in LBA).

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed SingleItemSlot.attemptExtraction using "maxAmount" for the slot rather than the stored slot index.
* Fixed ItemInvUtil.insertSingle modifying the stack given to it, unlike *everything else* in LBA.
