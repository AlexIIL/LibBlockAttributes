Changes:

* Added FluidTypeFilter, for checking if a fluid is a raw (minecraft) fluid, a floating fluid, or of a particular registry.
* Added FluidWorldUtil.createFluidDrainer and FluidWorldUtil.createFluidPlacer, which return a FluidExtractable and FluidInsertable that operate on the world directly.
* Added a few additional variants of FluidVolumeUtil.move that take a Simulation parameter.
* Undeprecate IBucketItem and make FluidContainerRegistry use it.
* Remove Grouped{Fluid/Item}InvFixedWrapper.getInsertionFilter() as it wasn't correct.
    (It returned all of the filters for every slot OR'd together, but ItemInsertable.getInsertionFilter() is meant to filter only item stacks where attemptInsertion would succeed).
