Breaking Changes:

* Renamed a LOT of classes to be more inline with fabric's naming convention.
    * Removed the "I" prefix from every interface that had it.
    * SearchParameter -> SearchOption
    * SearchParamDirectional -> SearchOptionDirectional
    * SearchParamInVoxel -> SearchOptionInVoxel
    * SearchParamDirectionalVoxel -> SearchOptionDirectionalVoxel
    * AttributeDefaulted -> DefaultedAttribute 
    * AttributeCombinable -> CombinableAttribute
    * IFluidItem -> FluidProviderItem

Changes:

* Added much better support for ordinary fluid classes - now lava is defined through the implicit fluids system without any problems.
* Added a static utility class "SearchOptions" which contains factories for creating all of the different types of SearchOption.
* Fixed fluid renders not binding the texture map and setting up blending before rendering.
* Added "FixedItemInvView.offerSelfAsAttribute" and "FixedFluidInvView.offerSelfAsAttribute" to make adding those classes (and subclasses) to an attribute list much quicker.
* Added "FluidVolume.renderGuiRect" as a quicker way of calling "FluidVolume.getRenderer().renderGuiRectangle()"
