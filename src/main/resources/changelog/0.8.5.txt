Changes:

* Made FluidVolume.getRenderColor default to using fabric's FluidRenderHandler if we're on the client and the caller hasn't explictly set it.
* Made SingleItemSlotView and SingleFluidTankView throw an exeption if you pass an out-of-bounds slot.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed the dropper mixin crashing when there's no non-empty slots to drop from.
