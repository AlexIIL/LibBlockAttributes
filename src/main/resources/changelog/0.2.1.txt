Breaking Changes:

* Removed SimpleFluidKey and SimpleFluidVolume - you should use NormalFluidKey and NormalFluidVolume instead.

Changes:

* Made NormalFluidKey and NormalFluidVolume not-abstract
* Changed FluidKeys.put(Fluid, FluidKey) to also register both the still and flowing variants of fluids if the fluid passed is a vanilla minecraft BaseFluid
* Added NormalFluidKey.builder(), as an (optional) replacement for a new NormalFluidKeyBuilder()
* Added NormalFluidKeyBuilder.build(), which is a shorter way of writing new NormalFluidKey(builder /* extra settings */);
