Breaking Changes:

* Moved all of the item attributes out of their own interfaces and into ItemAttributes.
    * This fixes a bug where every attribute's null instance was actually null, rather than a null object.
* Renamed "EmptyItemExtractable.NULL_EXTRACTABLE" to "NULL".
* Renamed "RejectingItemInsertable.NULL_INSERTABLE" to "NULL".
