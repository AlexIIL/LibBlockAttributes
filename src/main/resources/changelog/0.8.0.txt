Breaking Changes:

* Fixed a spelling mistake: "FluidTemperature.addTemperatueToTooltip" to "FluidTemperature.addTemperatureToTooltip".
* Changed the requirements for ItemFilter.matches to no longer return useful results for empty stacks - instead callers are expected to handle testing for empty stacks themselves.

Changes:

* Added FluidWorldUtil.fill, for placing fluid volumes into the world. (Shartte).
* Added FluidAmount.MAX_BUCKETS and MIN_BUCKETS, which have a whole of Long.MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE, but a numerator of 0.
* Changed FluidAmount.saturated* to return MAX_BUCKETS and MIN_BUCKETS instead of MAX_VALUE as that's much more useful.
* Added ResolvableItemFilter and ResolvableFluidFilter, for filters that can be resolved into a ReadableFluidFilter.
* Fixed "FixedInventoryViewVanillaWrapper.getInvStack" copying the inventories stack when it doesn't need to.
* Added various "toMcBuffer" methods to fluid keys, volumes, and properties
* Added FixedItemInv.insertStack and FixedItemInv.extractStack for inserting and extracting stacks from specific slots.
    * The signature is identical to ItemInvUtil.insertSingle and extractSingle, which are now deprecated.
* Added more
* Allowed BlockEntities to implement AttributeProviderBlockEntity as well as blocks to also expose attributes
* Added various methods to Attribute to map BlockEntity-based stuff (classes, attributes, BlockEntityType) to external attribute adders.

Bug Fixes:

* [#22] Fix a crash on dedicated servers.
* [#23] Fluids don't render in GUIs when using fabulous graphics mode.
