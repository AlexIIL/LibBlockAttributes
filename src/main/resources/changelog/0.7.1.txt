Changes:

* Added FluidWorldUtil.fill, for placing fluid volumes into the world. (Shartte).
* Added FluidAmount.MAX_NORMAL and MIN_NORMAL, which have a whole of Long.MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE, but a numerator of 0.
* Changed FluidAmount.saturated* to return MAX_NORMAL and MIN_NORMAL instead of MAX_VALUE as that's much more useful.

Bug Fixes:

* [#22] Fix a crash on dedicated servers.
* [#23] Fluids don't render in GUIs when using fabulous graphics mode.
